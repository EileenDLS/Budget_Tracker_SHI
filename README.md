# Budget_Tracker_SHI
In this application, you will allow me to indicate and track my spending per month for my indicated budget. 
Save my monthly budget and monthly expenditures in sessionStorage. 
When I reload the application, and I have saved data in sessionStorage, it should load it and allow me to see it.

I should be able to do the following actions:
- Add a new month and new budget
- Add, edit and delete expenditures. Save it back to localStorage

Suggested JSON data format:
[
   'date': '4/2023',
   'budget': 1342.22
   'expenditures': [{
      'description': 'pack of pens',
      'cost': 12.33
    }]
  }
]
